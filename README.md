# 🎬 Movie Financial Analysis using SQL

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a **financial data analysis of movies** using **SQL**.  
As a **finance and data analysis student**, I aimed to replicate my previous work (done with **Excel, Power BI, and Python**) using structured SQL queries to extract insights from movie-related datasets.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository includes several SQL scripts, each addressing a specific aspect of the analysis:

| File Name                    | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `1_create_tables.sql`       | Script to create the base tables for the analysis. |
| `2_statistiques_mesure.sql` | Measures and descriptive statistics for movies (e.g., revenue, budget). |
| `3_top_5_rentables.sql`     | Identifies the top 5 most profitable movies. |
| `movies_quality_audit.sql`  | Performs a quality audit on the movie dataset. |
| `temp_movie_profit_rank.sql`| Creates a temporary ranking of movies by profit. |

## 🚀 Purpose

- Practice SQL for financial analytics
- Explore profitability and ranking of movies
- Clean and audit data using SQL techniques
- Simulate real-world business intelligence tasks

## 📌 Notes

- No raw data is shared here, only SQL logic
- Queries are designed to be modular and reusable
- Future steps: create visual dashboards or connect to Excel/BI tools
